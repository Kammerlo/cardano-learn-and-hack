DA log, Epoch 555:

In our continuing quest to enhance the security of the Cardano ecosystem, I have encountered a formidable obstacle: inadequate accessibility to cutting-edge hardware wallets. These ingenious tools are instrumental in safeguarding digital transactions, yet they remain out of reach for the vast majority of potential users of Cardano.

Undeterred, I have conceived an innovative [solution](https://github.com/aleeusgr/achilles-boot) that leverages the gap: integrating Mobile-NixOS with smartphones to replicate the efficacy of hardware wallets. This pioneering approach effectively converts smartphones into veritable cryptocurrency guardians, capable of safeguarding Cardano wallets.

Yet, I do not intend for this invention to halt at mere wallets. Visioning a broader utility beyond cryptocurrency alone, I foresee a future in which smart devices manage and secure a wide ranging spectrum of sensitive data - a digital sanctum, shielded from cyber threats - secrets management beyond conventional wallet seeds shall unfold. The potential implications are revolutionary, promising to transform the very framework of digital safeguarding and user empowerment.

By boldly venturing into uncharted territories, we aim to democratize the benefits of cutting-edge security, and bring the unyielding fortress walls of data protection within the reach of every stakeholder in the galaxy of blockchain.
