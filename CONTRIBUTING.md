First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉

## Adding Challenges

Create a folder for your challenge and give it a funny name. Either drop a hint in the name or go totally random. Inside the folder, include a `README.md` file with the challenge description and a `banner.png` file for a banner image.

The `README.md` file needs these sections:  

- Title: Give your challenge a title. It should be short and catchy and match the folder name

- **Difficulty**: Choose one of the following emojis to represent the difficulty of the challenge:
  - Beginner 🐣
  - Intermediate 🐢
  - Advanced 🚀
  - Expert 🧠
  - Master 🏆

- **Category**: Choose one of the following emojis to represent the category of the challenge:
    - Wallets 👛
    - Smart Contracts 🧑‍💻
    - Cryptography 🔐
    - Infrastructure 🏗️
    - Governance 🏛️
    - NFTs 🎨
    - DeFi 💰

- **Description**: Write a short description of the challenge. This should include the context and information about the challenge.

If you've got a new category in mind, make sure to add it to the list in the root [Readme.md](./README.md) file too.
