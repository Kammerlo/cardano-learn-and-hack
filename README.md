# Cardano Learn & Hack

This project is all about making Cardano easier to dive into! We want to create a bunch of fun challenges and puzzles to help developers exploring the Cardano ecosystem in a gamified way.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Pick a folder that catches your eye and check out its `README.md` file. You'll find a short story or puzzle to solve inside.

We're working on something cool for the near future: letting you create an on-chain proof of your solution to showcase your Cardano skills!

## 🧩 Challenges

Each challenge kicks off with a title, a difficulty level:  
- Beginner 🐣  
- Intermediate 🐢  
- Advanced 🚀  
- Expert 🧠  
- Master 🏆  

And a category:  
- Wallets 👛  
- Smart Contracts 🧑‍💻  
- Cryptography 🔐  
- Infrastructure 🏗️  
- Governance 🏛️  
- NFTs 🎨  
- DeFi 💰  
- ...and more!  

After that, you'll see a banner and a description. The banner might tie into the challenge or just be a random image for fun. The description will give you the context and details you need to tackle the challenge.
